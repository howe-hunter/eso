## Module / Component Contributions

- Combat Info: Crowd Control Tracker: I received permission from dorrino from <esoui.com> to update and implement the features of Miat's CC Tracker into LuiExtended. Big thanks to dorrino for providing an excellent addon and saving me a ton of time trying to write my own component when a great addon like this already existed.
