# LuiExtended localization

If you'd like to help with LuiExtended localization, the easiest way to contribute is to submit a [pull request on GitHub][1] and modify whatever strings you want to adjust.

Please always work with the "develop" branch on the [LuiExtended GitHub project page][2].

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, feel free to reach out to me via email at [artofshred@artofshred.net][3], or you can directly send me your modified .lua file or specific strings through a file upload service or pastebin.
