Thank you for downloading LibEventHandler!

The main purpose of this library is to allow for a more versatile event handler than what ZOS provides 
through their EVENT_MANAGER. LibEventHandler expands the limitation of an event being incarcerated with 
only one function, to now being able to be linked to as many different functions as needed. In addition, 
it allows for the firing and registering of local events that you create within your addon. Together, 
these features enable this powerful tool to allow the developer to not only be more flexible with event 
managing, but also to be more clean, concise, and acyclical with code.

Zenimax's EVENT_MANAGER will still need to be used should you require registering any functions for update,
simply because I found theirs to be sufficient and did not need any more versatility.

Again, thanks a bunch! Have fun programming! :)
