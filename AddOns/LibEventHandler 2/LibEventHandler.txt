; AUTHOR NOTE:
; Thank you for downloading LibEventHandler!
;
; The main purpose of this library is to allow for a more versatile event handler than what ZOS provides 
; through their EVENT_MANAGER. LibEventHandler expands the limitation of an event being incarcerated with 
; only one function, to now being able to be linked to as many different functions as needed. In addition, 
; it allows for the firing and registering of local events that you create within your addon. Together, 
; these features enable this powerful tool to allow the developer to not only be more flexible with event 
; managing, but also to be more clean, concise, and acyclical with code.
; 
; Zenimax's EVENT_MANAGER will still need to be used should you require registering any functions for update,
; simply because I found theirs to be sufficient and did not need any more versatility.
; 
; Again, thanks a bunch! Have fun programming! :)
