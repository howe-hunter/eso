Updated API version.

2020-11-15 - Version 20

Fixed an issue that could cause Meridia's Light to shine somewhere off in the distance rather than on your blessed group members while in Imperial City or Blackreach. Worship of Meridia, once fallen out of favour in these regions, has seen an uptick; this may or may not be a coincidence.

Updated for API version 29.

2019-08-16 - Version 16

bit brighter than the rest - to individual group members.  To do so, target the
group member, open the Interact With Player radial menu and Invoke Meridia's
Blessing upon them.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Light to appear on a group member that was
in a different instance of the same zone.

Fixed a long-standing issue that caused the Light to flicker or briefly appear
and disappear while transitioning between zone subregions.

Fixed an issue that could sometimes cause Battleground and Cyrodiil teammates'
Lights to fail to display.

2019-08-12 - Version 13

Revised the visuals of the Light beams.

2019-05-19 - Version 11

Support for Elsweyr API version.

2019-04-30 - Version 10

Added a new Setting:

trees and terrain.

2019-04-13 - Version 9

Adjusted the brightness, height and visuals of Meridia's Light.

Fixed a separate LUA error that could occur upon initial login for some configurations.

2019-04-11 - Version 6, 7

Added a new option to the Settings panel to enable or disable the
Light for all non-Leader/Tank/Healer group members.

Developed a workaround for the issue that caused the Lights to sometimes
linger or fail to change color appropriately.

Fixed an issue that caused the Lights to fail to appear in dungeon
instances within Cyrodiil.

Fixed an issue that caused a LUA error to appear upon logging in for the first time.

2019-04-07 - Version 5

Revised the Light assignment logic to provide more consistent correlation
between the visual effect and the associated player.

2019-04-06 - Version 4

Addressed a second underlying cause of the Lights sometimes shifting away
from players' actual positions in response to a change in cell location.
More fixes to come should the issue persist.

2019-04-06 - Version 3

Extended the skyward reach of Meridia's Lights to be roughly twice as high.

Addressed at least one underlying cause of the Lights sometimes shifting away
from players' actual positions in response to a change in cell location.
More fixes to come should the issue persist.

Changed the default setting to "OFF" for:
 Light of Healers
 Light of Tanks
This change will not impact anyone who has explicitly changed this setting at least once.

2019-04-05 - Version 2

Fixed an issue that caused the "Defaults" button on the Settings screen
to reset the Light Brightness and Magnitude to nearly invisible values.

2019-04-03 - Version 1
